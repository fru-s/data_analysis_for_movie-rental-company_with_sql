# data_analysis_for_movie-rental-company_with_sql
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. My goal as a data analyst in the business intelligence (BI)  department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. 
### Objective
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a fictional movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. 
My goal as data analyst at Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, I used SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have. 

### Key Questions
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain? 
- What was the average rental duration for all videos? 
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in? 
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based? 
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
